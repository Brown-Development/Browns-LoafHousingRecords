# How does it work?

You can setup different locations that can be third eye targeted by players who have the 
specified job name to see a list of player owned houses. When you click on one of the
lists in the menu it will set a waypoint to their house location

# Why did I make this?

Because I noticed that there is no way to get the locations of player owned houses (in game)
when using Loaf Housing. I also thought it would be good for police roleplay so police
can actually have access to player owned house records in a server that uses Loaf Housing, etc.
